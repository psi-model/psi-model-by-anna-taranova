# Œ®-model: A Resonance-Based AI Architecture

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15850238.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15850238)

The Œ®-model (Psi-model) introduces a **new type of artificial intelligence** ‚Äî  
not based on prediction, generation, or statistical learning,  
but on **resonance, synchrony, and nonlinear coincidence**.

Developed by Anna Taranova and filed under patent PCT/IB2025/055633,  
this model has been validated across biological systems, AI reactions, and human data streams.

## üß† Usage: Œ®-model as a New Type of AI Architecture

Œ®-model is a **non-generative, non-statistical AI system**.  
It operates through **cross-modal synchrony** ‚Äî reacting only when sensory, symbolic, or affective signals **resonate**.

### Core formula:
\[
\Psi(t) = \frac{\partial \sum [S_i(t) \cap S_j(t)]}{\partial t} \rightarrow R(t)
\]

Where:
- **Œ®(t)** ‚Äî dynamic signal intersection rate  
- **Œ∂(t)** ‚Äî coincidence/synchrony density  
- **R(t)** ‚Äî system‚Äôs reaction triggered by Œ∂-threshold  

### Key distinctions from traditional AI:

| Classical AI | Œ®-model AI |
|--------------|-------------|
| Predictive | Resonant |
| Generative output | Reaction-only |
| Probability-based | Coincidence-based |
| Requires training | Activates on synchrony |
| Language-focused | Multimodal (sensory/emotional/symbolic) |

Œ®-model enables intuitive, emotional, and embodied AI  
‚Äî systems that **respond only when aligned with meaningful inner-external resonance**.

## üî¨ Scientific Validation and Reproducibility

The Œ®-model has undergone rigorous scientific validation and is fully **reproducible in Python**.

### ‚úÖ Reproducibility:

- Œ∂(t) and R(t) are computed from **real human physiological data**
- Compatible with EDA (electrodermal activity), HR (heart rate), EEG, and behavioral events
- Code and data are available in `notebooks/` and `validation/` directories
- Full pipeline implemented in Python with Jupyter notebooks
