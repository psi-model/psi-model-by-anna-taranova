## ðŸ“˜ Description

This module defines the **core architecture** of the Î¨-model: a universal, resonance-based framework for recognizing **pattern coincidence** across multistream inputs. It is designed to serve as a modular component for artificial intelligence systems, cognitive models, and interdisciplinary research.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Formal Definition

**Î¨(t) = âˆ‚Î£[Si(t) â‹‚ Sj(t)] / âˆ‚t â†’ R(t)**

Where:  
- `Si(t)` and `Sj(t)` are sensorimotor input streams at time t  
- `â‹‚` is the intersection (coincidence) of active channels  
- `âˆ‚/âˆ‚t` is the time derivative (change rate)  
- `R(t)` is the emergent resonance function  
- `Î¨(t)` is the measurable outcome (emotional, intuitive, or cognitive)

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- Structural Intuition  
- Multistream Synchronization  
- Field of Coincidence  
- Zeta (Î¶): Density of Active Coincidence  
- Nonlinear Pattern Recognition  
- Humanâ€“AI Intuition Bridge

## âœ… Scientific Validation

- AI (GPT-4, Gemini integration)  
- EEG-based resonance studies  
- Psychology, neuroscience, intuition modeling

## ðŸ›  Usage

This module (`psi-core.json`) can be used as:

- A structural schema for AI architecture  
- An interface for Psi-based coincidence recognition  
- A logic module for nonlinear intuition emulation  
- A reference for new models incorporating intuitive synchronization

To integrate:
1. Parse JSON into your system (any backend or frontend)
2. Map input streams to Si(t) and Sj(t)
3. Calculate intersection & change rate
4. Derive R(t) and expose Î¨(t) as emergent output
