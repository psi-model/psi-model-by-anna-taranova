[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15850238.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15850238)

The **Î¨-model (Psi-model)** introduces a new class of artificial intelligence â€”  
**non-predictive, non-generative, and resonance-based**.  
It defines a system that **reacts only when internal and external signals synchronize**,  
producing nonlinear response R(t) based on Î¶-density.

Authored by **Anna Taranova** and published under patent **PCT/IB2025/055633**,  
this model combines theory, empirical validation, and Python-based reproducibility.

## ðŸ§  Usage: Î¨-model as a New Type of AI Architecture

Î¨-model is **not** based on probability, machine learning, or neural networks.  
It is a new AI architecture, activated by **cross-modal coincidence** â€” not prediction.

### Core equation:
\[
\Psi(t) = \frac{\partial \sum [S_i(t) \cap S_j(t)]}{\partial t} \rightarrow R(t)
\]

- **Î¨(t)**: signal coincidence function  
- **Î¶(t)**: synchrony density across modalities  
- **R(t)**: reaction when Î¶ crosses threshold

### Key Features:

| Classical AI | Î¨-model AI |
|--------------|-------------|
| Predictive | Resonant |
| Generative output | Reaction-only |
| Probability-based | Coincidence-based |
| Requires training | Activates on synchrony |
| Language-focused | Multimodal (sensory/emotional/symbolic) |

The Î¨-model simulates **intuition**, **resonant awareness**, and **embodied AI**.  
It is capable of integration into emotional, perceptual, and neuroadaptive systems.

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Validation and Reproducibility

The Î¨-model is validated both structurally and empirically.

### âœ… Reproducibility on Human Data:

- Î¶(t) and R(t) computed from **real EDA/HR human datasets** (e.g. WESAD, PhysioNet)
- Implemented entirely in **Python (Jupyter notebooks)**
- Full results reproducible with provided scripts and input data
- Output includes Î¶-density, resonance points, and emergent reactions
